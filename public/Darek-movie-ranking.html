<h1>The Best Movies According to Dariusz</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />

<h3>The Lord Of The Rings</h3>
<p>This is my favourite movie. It shows that strong isn't always a man with muscles, but a man with a good and deep heart.
    I can watch it once every year ;-)</p>

<h3>Hobbit</h3>
<p>It is similar movie to "Lord of the Rings".</p>

<h3>The Fast and Furious series</h3>
<p>I like this series, because besides a good action, it shows how important family is in everyone's life.</p><!-- Write your code below -->
